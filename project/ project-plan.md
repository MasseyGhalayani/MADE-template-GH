# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Unveiling Key Predictors of Cardiovascular Disease in Patient Data

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. In patients, what are the main indicators of cardiovascular disease based on clinical, physiological, and demographic data?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The goal of the study is to examine data on cardiovascular illness in order to identify the variables that affect a patient's likelihood of having heart disease. Using a range of patient data, including age, gender, kind of chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more, this research will pinpoint important factors and create a heart disease prediction model. The knowledge acquired will support cardiovascular disease prevention and early diagnosis.  
By finding important heart disease predictors, the effort will also advance our understanding of cardiovascular research.
## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

* Data Type: CSV

 
This dataset includes a binary classification indicating the presence or absence of heart disease together with a number of patient health variables, such as age, gender, kind of chest discomfort, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and more.
