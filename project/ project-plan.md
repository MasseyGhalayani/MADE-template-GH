# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of Climate Change on Sea Ice Extent

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How has the extent of sea ice changed over time in relation to global temperature changes?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The goal of this study is to use historical data to examine the relationship between changes in sea ice extent and global temperature. Examining these two crucial facets of Earth's climate system will help us understand how global warming affects the polar regions. Preprocessing and gathering data on temperature anomalies and sea ice extent will be part of the project. Additionally, exploratory data analysis, relevant feature engineering, and the creation of prediction models will all be involved. Understanding sea ice extent trends and patterns and forecasting future changes based on temperature data are the ultimate goals. This analysis can advance our knowledge of the wider effects of climate change and assist in guiding climate policy.

The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) supports research into our world’s frozen realms: the snow, ice, glaciers, frozen ground, and climate interactions that make up Earth’s cryosphere. NSIDC manages and distributes scientific data, creates tools for data access, supports data users, performs scientific research, and educates the public about the cryosphere.

The FAOSTAT Temperature Change domain disseminates statistics of mean surface temperature change by country, with annual updates. The current dissemination covers the period 1961–2019. Statistics are available for monthly, seasonal and annual mean temperature anomalies, i.e., temperature change with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1951–1980.
